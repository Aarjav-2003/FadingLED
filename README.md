# FadingLED
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates how to create a fading LED effect using an Arduino. By varying the brightness of an LED connected to one of the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins on the Arduino, we can create a smooth fading effect. This is a simple yet effective way to learn about PWM and basic Arduino programming.</p>
